<strong> </strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

The following workshop lets you practice basic java coding techniques, creating classes, methods, using arrays, Java I/O, inheritance, polymorphism, Exceptional Handling, JavaFx (GUI). The focus will be practicing for JavaFx concepts.




<strong>Task 1: </strong>Write a program to display a simple Address Book screen as show below










<strong> </strong>

<strong>Task 2 (Event-Handling): </strong>The following task is a continuity of <strong><em>Task – 1</em></strong>and based on some research as well.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Research Part: </strong>

During the lecture of <u>Week 5</u> and in the <u>workshop 4</u> you have practiced different concepts on

<ul>

 <li>How to read a file.</li>

 <li>How to write a file.</li>

 <li>Mostly everyone has practiced FileReader or FileWriter, FileInputStream or FileOutputStream, Buffered Readers etc.</li>

 <li>Task – 2 required you to first search on <strong>RandomAccessFile </strong>in Java<strong>,</strong> o

  <ul>

   <li>Where to use it.</li>

   <li>How to use it.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

Once you have read about the advantages and disadvantages of the RandomAccessFile in java then you can start the coding for the workshop.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Coding Part: </strong>




Write a program that stores, retrieves, adds and updates addresses as shown in the figure below.

<ul>

 <li>Use <strong><em>random access file </em></strong>for reading and writing an address.</li>

 <li>When the program starts your files should contains minimum 5 proper records <strong>[make sure the added records are proper not some random strings and/ or postal code etc]</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Hint: </strong>Use fixed-length string for storing each attribute in the address.










<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Deliverables for Task – 2: </strong>there will be two different deliverables for this workshop.

<ol>

 <li>A word document includes your findings about Random Access File.

  <ol>

   <li>Advantages</li>

   <li>Disadvantages</li>

   <li></li>

   <li></li>

   <li>Constructors</li>

   <li>Methods</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<strong>Note: </strong>Also include your references from where you search.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Code for the application.</li>

</ol>

Deliverables and Important Notes:




<strong>All these deliverables are supposed to be uploaded on the blackboard once done. </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ul>

 <li>You are supposed to create video/ record voice/ detailed document of your running solution. <strong>(50%)</strong>  o Screen Video captured file should state your last name and id, like</li>

</ul>

Ali_123456.mp4 (or whatever the extension of the file is) o Record voice clip should also include a separate word file with the screen shots of your program’s output, state your last name and id, like Ali_123456.mp3 (or whatever the extension of the file is)

o Detailed document should include screen shots of your output, have your name and id on the top of the file and save the file with your last name and id, like Ali_123456.docx (or whatever the extension of the file is)

<ul>

 <li>A word/ text file which will reflect on learning of your concepts in this workshop. Also include the instructions on how to run your code.                                 <strong>(30%)</strong>

  <ul>

   <li>Should state your Full name and Id on the top of the file and save the file with your last name and id, like Ali_123456.txt</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Submission of working code.                                                                         <strong>(20%)</strong>

  <ul>

   <li>Make sure your follow the “<strong>Code Submission Criteria”</strong> mentioned above.</li>

   <li>You should zip your whole working project to a file named after your Last Name followed by the first 3 digits of your student ID. For example, zip.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Your marks will be deducted according to what is missing from the above-mentioned submission details.</li>

 <li>Late submissions would result in additional 10% penalties for each day or part of it.</li>
